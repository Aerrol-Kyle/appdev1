1 . As a manager, I  don't really have personal experiences to be able to determine how to solve this current issue, but I think this could be solved by seeking other support from other members that can do that part. We need to break down the tasks that need to be done into smaller and manageable tasks and assign them to the members who can do the tasks effectively and according to their skills and confidence, to be able to keep up with the deadline and avoid giving them too much workload.
For the developer who is facing personal family problems, we could give empathy support to avoid giving him/her too much pressure. We will inform him/her that the tasks are going to be distributed then he/she can provide help if possible just to make it and finish the project in the said deadline. I will also inform the client to keep transparency regarding the project status.
2. If I were the developer facing this personal issue, the first thing I would do is inform my manager and the team about my situation, while assuring them that I will continue to help whenever possible. I would let them know that I am committed to returning to full capacity as soon as I am able to resolve the issue.
Before I deal with those personal problems, I will try to accomplish as much of my current workload as possible, ensuring that the tasks I am working on are at a point where others can pick them up seamlessly. This way, my manager can reassign the remaining tasks to other team members without causing delays to the project deadline.
3. Both the manager and the developer could have anticipated potential risks and better mitigated the situation. For the manager, a proactive approach would have involved identifying risks early and ensuring that tasks were cross-trained among team members. This would have allowed other developers to step in quickly if needed. Additionally, the manager could have built buffer time into the project’s timeline to accommodate unexpected issues and maintained regular communication with the client and team to keep everyone aligned.
For the developer, early communication about personal challenges would have allowed the manager to reassign tasks and adjust the workload before the crisis affected progress. The developer could have prioritized key tasks to ensure critical work was completed first, and set clear expectations about availability. Offering limited support during time away or completing as much work as possible before taking leave would have also helped.
A personal crisis protocol, with pre-established guidelines for communication and task redistribution, would have allowed both the manager and developer to handle the situation more smoothly, ensuring the project stayed on track.
