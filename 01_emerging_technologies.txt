Usage:
Education: Biometric systems are used for secure access to facilities, attendance tracking, and exam monitoring in schools and universities.
IT Industry: IT companies deploy biometric solutions for secure authentication, enhancing security in workplaces and financial transactions.

Examples:
Education: Some universities use facial recognition for automated attendance and access control in dormitories.
IT: Apple’s Face ID and Microsoft’s Windows Hello use biometric authentication to provide secure, password-free access to devices.

2. Edge Computing

Purpose: Edge computing brings data processing closer to the source of data generation, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. The aim is to enable faster and more efficient data handling in real-time applications.

Usage:
  Education: Edge computing is integrated into IoT labs and courses to teach students how to deploy, manage, and optimize distributed systems. Educational institutions may use edge solutions to support smart campus initiatives.
  IT: Improving application performance in manufacturing, healthcare, telecommunications, and other fields will rely heavily on edge computing. IT organizations adopt edge computing solutions to enhance system response times and facilitate decentralized data processes.

Examples:
  Education: Smart classrooms using edge devices to manage real-time data for adaptive learning tools.
  IT: Edge AI systems that provide analytics for IoT devices in smart factories.

 3. Internet of Things (IoT)

Purpose: IoT connects everyday devices to the internet, enabling communication, data collection, and control between devices, thereby creating smarter environments.

Usage:
  Education: IoT is used in creating smart campuses with connected devices, automating tasks like attendance tracking, and energy management. It’s also employed in teaching IoT development and applications.
  IT: IT organizations implement IoT solutions in smart cities, manufacturing, and logistics. They develop secure networks, manage device communication protocols, and analyze data generated by IoT devices.

Examples:
  Education: Connected classrooms where sensors monitor environmental conditions and automate lighting and HVAC systems.
  IT:  IoT-enabled predictive maintenance systems in factories.

4. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Purpose: AI seeks to automate tasks, provide decision-making support, and improve system intelligence by analyzing vast amounts of data and learning from patterns.

Usage:
  Education: AI is transforming education by providing personalized learning experiences through adaptive learning systems, automating administrative tasks, and enabling research in AI-related fields. As mentioned above, it aims to ease an individual's daily work.
  IT: AI is integral to IT, where it powers applications in customer service, cybersecurity, software development, and data analytics. IT companies focus on AI-driven innovation to improve processes and enhance productivity. Company’s employees such as developers can use the AI to seek and enhance their working capabilities resulting in speeding up their work.

Examples:
